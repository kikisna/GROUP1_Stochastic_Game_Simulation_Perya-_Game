## 📝 Mathematical Foundation

### Fair Game
    Probability per color = 1/6 ≈ 16.67%
    Payout multiplier = 5x
    Expected Value (EV) = 0
    House Edge = 0%

### Tweaked Game
    Weighted probabilities (e.g., 14% vs 20%)
    Reduced payout multiplier (e.g., 4.8x)
    Expected Value = negative
    House Edge = (Fair EV - Actual EV) / Bet × 100%

### Key Formulas
    EV = Σ(Probability × Payout) - Cost
    House Edge = 1 - (Player EV / Bet Amount)
    Risk of Ruin = ((1 - p)/p)^(B/b)
