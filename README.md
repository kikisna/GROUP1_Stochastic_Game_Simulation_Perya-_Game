# GROUP1_Stochastic_Game_Simulation_Perya-_Game
This project simulates a Filipino "Perya" (carnival) Color Game to demonstrate modeling and simulation concepts with Python. The application compares a fair game against a tweaked version with house edge, using Monte Carlo simulation to analyze long-term outcomes.
